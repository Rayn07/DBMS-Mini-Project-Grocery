# 🚀 Project Setup Guide

Instructions on how to set up and run the **Frontend** and **Backend** components of this project.

---

## 💻 Backend Setup

The backend is built using Node.js and requires `nodemon` to run the server.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (ensure it is installed)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Running the Backend

1.  **Navigate** to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install** the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

3.  **Start** the server using `nodemon`:
    ```bash
    nodemon server.js
    ```
    The server should now be running, typically accessible at a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## 🌐 Frontend Setup

The frontend is a simple static application.

### Running the Frontend

1.  **Open** the main HTML file directly in your web browser:
    ```bash
    # From the project root, open this file in your browser
    open index.html 
    ```
